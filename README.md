# Traffic Sign Classification
> A convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I design and implement a convolutional neural network in Python using TensorFlow. The model is based off of the LeNet-5 architecture. I train and validate a convolutional neural network using traffic sign images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The entire data pipeline is constructed in a Jupyter Notebook and a detailed writeup is also provided.

This project was undertaken as part of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).
